## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

 
 在完全二叉树中，除了最底层节点可能没填满外，其余每层节点数都达到最大值，并且最下面一层的节点都集中在该层最左边的若干位置。若最底层为第 h 层，则该层包含 1~ 2^(h-1)  个节点。

 ```java
 /**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    // 通用递归解法
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        return countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) + 1;
    }
}
```
