Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

## solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # Calculate the effective rotation steps by taking k modulo the length of the array
        k = k % len(nums)
        
        # Split the array into two parts and concatenate them in reverse order
        nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
solution.rotate(nums, k)
print(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
